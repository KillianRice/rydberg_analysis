function avgDataset = param_ext_MeanNum(analyVar,indivDataset,avgDataset)
% Function to calculate the mean atomic number from the number calculated
% previously.
%
% INPUTS:
%   analyVar     - structure of all pertinent variables for the imagefit
%                  routines
%   indivDataset - Cell of structures containing all scan/batch
%                  specific data
%   avgDataset   - Cell of structures containing grouped data for averaging
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   avgDataset - Cell of structures containing grouped data for
%                averaging. Fields below will be added to avgDataset when it is output 
%                  avgTotNum  - Mean of total number of atoms (in each window)
%                  avgBECNum  - Mean of total number of atoms in condensate (if present)
%                  avgThrmNum - Mean of total number of thermal atoms (if bimodal condensate)
%
% NOTE:
%   1. Be careful of the distinction between the batch list variables and the
%      unique scan variables. The batch list variables are variables which every batch
%      has (here a batch is one set of images). Since we often
%      scan a higher parameter when taking data (ex. laser intensity or
%      relative detunings) one particular batch variable is used to group scans that were
%      taken using the same set of parameters (have all the same batch variables).
%      Thus the unique scan variables defines only those unique scan
%      parameters. 
%
%   2. The code below considers each unique scan in turn. For each unique
%      scan we find all batches sharing the same variables and construct a
%      matrix of the number of atoms for each independent variable. This
%      gives a matrix where the number of columns is the number of batches
%      in the unique scan and the rows are the unique time points within
%      the unique scan. 
%      As an example consider taking 10 datasets of the same parameter 
%      (i.e. detuning) but for 5 datasets there was a 2ms time step over 40
%      images and for the remaining 5 there was a 5ms timestep over 25
%      images. Since time was all that changed we can average over all 10
%      batches but there are not 65 unique time points because every 5th
%      image of the 2ms batches is the same time as the 5ms batches. This
%      gives (40+25)-(2*40)/5 = 49 unique time points. Thus the matrix used to average
%      over all points (within this unique scan) will have 10 columns
%      (number of batches) and 49 rows. Those time points that don't match
%      up between scans are filled with NaN and disregarded when taking the
%      average (using nanmea)
